        "specializing in locally sourced and seasonal food expertly prepared with an extra dollop of love the husband/wife team of Mike Quinn and Julie Klein offer vegans and omnivores alike a place to dine together happily"

				"... Lovin' Oven was packed to capacity because of the food. Before it moved to Frenchtown from Milford in March, the restaurant, owned by the husband-and-wife team Julie Klein and Mike Quinn, already had a loyal following. The couple's commitment to cooking with local ingredients and to baking on the premises, including the beloved sweet potato biscuits, has earned it the devotion of locavores as well as those who never end a meal without dessert."

				"The ingredients are as fresh as it gets, and the food is simple yet delicious in a time when too much is over thought. The service is dressed with non-stop smiles, and the oven is run on homespun love. When Julie and Mike wrote the menu to say "We're so glad you're here," they meant it."
